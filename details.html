			<p id="detail">
				The Maldives, a tropical haven of immaculate beaches, are an archipelago of 1,192 coral islands grouped into natural atolls, out of which only few are inhabited. Time stands still in Maldives as you lie on the white sand beaches, hearing the crystal clear waves crash against the seashore, swim with the manta rays and reef sharks and feast on a wide array of fishes with the locals. Be it adventure or leisure, Maldives is your answer.

				Floating on the translucent waters, Maldives is a divine paradise for those looking for a getaway from the daily humdrum of city life, with attractions unparalleled. With its sun-kissed beaches, palm-fringed islands, crystalline lagoons and pristine waters, Maldives enthralls and draws visitors all year round. The resorts here are an entire island itself usually, including stay options like overwater bungalows. Imagine having a room on a pier jutting out from the shore with a glass floor under which tropical fish can be seen swimming! Renowned for its incredible diving opportunities, the azure waters of Maldives, are home to diverse marine life and corals of distinct hues. While the vivid blue lagoons are perfect for snorkeling, the reef walls offer a kaleidoscope of sea life for more experienced divers, making it a haven for water sports enthusiasts. The capital city of Male is both the commercial and financial capital. Seat to the executive, legislature and judiciary, this city is a tourist favourite as well. The history lovers will be satiated here, given Male houses several buildings and monuments of historical importance. Male is easily accessible by ferry boats from the airports. Travel to other islands in Maldives is also quite feasible from here. Be it island hopping, candlelight dinner by the sea, breakfast ferry to an uninhabited island (yes, this is possible), scuba diving or even dolphin watching for all you leisure lovers, this idyllic holiday will never afford you an idle moment!
